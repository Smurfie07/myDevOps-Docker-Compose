## Part 2 Multi-Container Application Deployment using Docker Compose

●	Create a Docker file for the web application container which should include the necessary dependencies to run the web application. The web application should display a simple "Hello, World!" message when accessed from a web browser. (5 marks)
A simple flask app which will route page to return "Hello DevOps World!"

●	Create a Docker file for the database container which should include the necessary dependencies to run the database. You can use any database of your choice (e.g.,MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.). (5 marks)
●	Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines the two services - web and database. The web service should be linked to the database service using Docker Compose networking. (5 marks)
●	Use the docker-compose up command to build and run the application. Verify that the web application is accessible from a web browser and that the database is running. (5 marks)
●	Modify the Docker file for the web application container to include a new feature (e.g., a new message, a new page, etc.). Rebuild the web application container and redeploy the application using docker-compose. Verify that the new feature is working as expected. (10 marks)
●	Implement a backup strategy for the database. This can be achieved using a Docker volume or by running a backup script periodically. (10 marks)
●	Implement a scaling strategy for the web application. This can be achieved by using the docker-compose scale command to create multiple instances of the web service. Verify that the web application is accessible and working correctly when scaled. (10 marks)
●	Implement a monitoring strategy for the application. This can be achieved by using a tool like Prometheus or Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the containers. (10 marks)
●	Create a README.md file and document your findings for each command. For each command, provide a brief description of what it does, followed by the output and logs generated by the command. Ensure that the README.md file is well-organized, easy to read, and contains all necessary information. (20 marks)
●	Push the codebase for the sample application to your GitHub repository (create a new one for this part)
